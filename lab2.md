# Lab 2: Reproducing Locally

## Let's get started! 

In this lab, you will learn how to reproduce the lighttpd exploit. You will:

  * Introduce the basics of running a Docker image. 
  * Show you how to use `nc` (netcat) to send results over a network.
  * Introduce the notion of mounting your local folder. 


**Time to complete**: About 20 minutes

## Previous Lab

In the previous lab, you ran the `lighttpd` analysis. We assume you've already
run analysis, and the `mayhem` CLI is still logged in.

## Download results locally

You download results using the `mayhem download` command, specifying an output
directory with `-o`.  

```
mayhem download tutorial/lighttpd -o /tmp/lighttpd
```

## Run docker image

Docker is a lightweight container, which is like a virtual 
machine but at the UNIX process level. 

![Docker vs VM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbrumley/fuzzing-cloudshell-tutorial/master/assets/images/docker-vs-vm.jpeg)

While a full docker tutorial is out of scope here, we show you here some basic
nuts and bolts. We recommend you take some time to read the Docker
[tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/). 


To run the vulnerable image:
```
docker run --rm -i -d -p 8080:80 forallsecure/lighttpd:vulnerable
```

This command:

  * Runs the docker image `training.forallsecure.com:5000/forallsecure/tutorial/lighttpd`
  * The `-p` binds port 80 in the docker image to localhost port 8080
  * The `--rm` removes any temporary state when the
    container exits.
  * The `-d` says to run in daemon mode, i.e., as a background 
    process.

To check that the docker image is running, run the `docker ps` command:

```
docker ps
```



Since this is a network server, we will use a utility called
`nc` (netcat) to connect to the server and feed the test case generated by
Mayhem. For example:

```
nc localhost 8080 < ./corpus/ba0dbafbd0b787a564635b887f77926ae0b3f979dcc72d30cf7fdb1707581919
```

If you replay the exploit, then you should see container no longer exists:

```
docker ps
```

You just replayed a test case that exists *outside* the docker container.  Think
of it like connecting to a remote machine. The container no longer exists
because lighttpd crashed after replaying the Mayhem generated exploit.

## Congratulations

While you've just touched the iceberg of docker, you've also just replayed an
exploit. Congratulations!
